From the data, these cities show and have a dense yet diverse cultural background. However, which city is more diverse in terms of having a multicultural background? My Capstone Project for this Course, Applied Data Science Capstone, will revolve around the question above, comparing the two cities (New York and Toronto) based on its cultural variety.\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","___\n","\n","<br/>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q9iNdooZkCex","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# __The Battle of Neighborhoods__ *Background and Methods for:[Data]*\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","To incorporate the use of FourSquare API and its Venue Searching Capabilities around the city neighborhood, I will be specifically looking for food venues in the city. In addition to the Postal Code Data and the Borough/Neighborhoods's respective Latitude and Longitude Values in place for both New York City and Toronto, my project will take into account the population of each city, the land area of each city, and the amount of Boroughs each city has. To be specific, my project will be mainly revolved around FourSquare APIs Search Option for CategoryID. The CategoryID for Food, which is 4d4b7105d754a06374d81259, will be used to create a DataFrame that consists of the types of venues for Restaurants. By using Restaurants, we can gain a better understanding of both city's historical backgrounds on Food and put that into consideration for which city has a more multicultural background. And if the Search Option for Foods gives too many broad category types for venues, my project will specify the type of cuisine to look for. From the amount of culturally diverse restaurants and the comparison to the population and size of the city, it will be safer to say which city (New York or Toronto) is more culturally diverse.\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wB938KSaM-pI","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
